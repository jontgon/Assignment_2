Vector Visulaization

Hypothesis: The density of weather station distribiution decreases with an increase in latitude.
Humans are more concered with the weather in their immediate vicinity, and as the population density
of a region decreases, so too will the number of weather stations. 
This trend can be easily observed in the vector visualization below which displays the location of all
weather stations in Canada.
