Vector Visulaization

Hypothesis: The density of weather station distribiution in Canada decreases as latitude increases.

Humans are more concered with the weather in their immediate vicinity, and as the population density
of a region decreases, so too will the number of weather stations. 
The vector visualization below displays the location of all weather stations in Canada. 
Notice the decrease in weather station density trending northward. 
This distribution could inadvertently comprimise climate models that are based on the observations 
from these weather stations.

After the presentation I rendered another vector visualization in ArcMap (shown below) with a
different projection, color coded provinces, and graticules lableing latitude and longitude.
